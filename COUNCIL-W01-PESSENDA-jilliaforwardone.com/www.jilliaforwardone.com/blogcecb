<p><span>As an Edison High School graduate and former neighbor, Northeast Minneapolis is near and dear to my heart. I believe that the residents of Ward One deserve a Council Member who will listen to their concerns and amplify their voices at City Hall. Jillia Pessenda is that person, and that’s why I am endorsing her for City Council</span></p><p><span>She is grounded in grassroots, people-powered action. She knows that when we come together to solve our problems, we can create sustainable change. </span></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://act.myngp.com/Forms/1333157773443598848"><span>You can endorse Jillia too by making a donation to her campaign.</span></a></p><p><span>Her success in changing city-zoning laws to allow urban farming and market gardening demonstrates that she has what it takes to be an effective leader and make an impact on the City Council. </span><span>As the finance director of my campaign, I know Jillia’s work ethic. When she sets her mind on something, she maps out how it can be accomplished and then gets it done. So, when she says she will </span><span>create a more just and visionary city in partnership with community members, it excites me.</span></p><p><span>Jillia will center her work around </span><span>gender and racial justice. These are not just buzzwords to her. As a staff member at Project 515, she worked on the campaign to win marriage equality for same-sex couples. And at OutFront Minnesota, she was part of the coalition that passed the country’s most comprehensive anti-bullying bill, which provides protections for </span><em>all</em><span> students.</span></p><p><span>Jillia is committed to increasing the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 and will fight for stable workplace protections, like secure schedules. She will advocate to keep housing costs affordable, so no one is pushed out of the neighborhood. She will also invest in our neighborhoods by tackling climate change and providing support for small businesses as well as advancing opportunities for women artists, artists of color and LGBTQ artists.</span></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://act.myngp.com/Forms/684639427102247424"><span>If you live in Ward One, I urge you to caucus for Jillia on April 4.</span></a><span> She will be a progressive champion for all of us and move our city forward!</span></p><p><span>In Unity and Justice,</span></p><p><span>Ilhan Omar</span></p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></description></item><item><title>Join me next Thursday for our campaign kickoff event!</title><dc:creator>Felicia Pruitt Brown</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 01:04:21 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.jilliaforwardone.com/blog/2016/12/29/join-me-next-thursday-for-our-campaign-kickoff-event</link><guid isPermaLink="false">58258046be6594da1eacca8f:584afca29de4bbb030ff11fa:5865b29cbebafb87e53c3545</guid><description><![CDATA[

<h3><span>Dear Friends,</span></h3><p><strong><span>I am excited to share some news with you: I am running for Minneapolis City Council in Ward 1 and will be seeking the DFL endorsement at the convention in April.</span></strong></p><p><span>We face significant challenges and now, more than ever, we need a proactive leader at City Hall who will work with us to drive progressive issues forward. </span></p><p><span>It is clear from the outcome of the election that we must take it upon ourselves to create positive change in our own community because progress at the state and federal level will be lacking. We live in a time that demands urgency and action. We must fight to increase the minimum wage to $15/hour and fight for stable workplace protections. We must keep Northeast an affordable place to live and we must invest in improving our neighborhoods by providing opportunities for small business owners, artists and eliminate racial disparities in our city. </span></p><p><span>Working with city officials on urban agriculture, fighting foreclosures, and advocating for youth and families, I have seen firsthand how we can solve problems in our city when elected leaders listen and proactively collaborate with community members. Too often, members of our city council have maintained the status quo instead of championing the change we need.</span></p><p><span>I have dedicated my life to bringing people together to solve problems and create positive change in our community, and I want to bring that experience to City Hall as our Ward 1 Council Member.</span></p><p><span>I hope to earn your support and I look forward to talking with you about our shared progressive values. <em><strong><a href="https://act.myngp.com/Forms/540524239026391552">You can join our campaign today by signing up to receive updates!</a> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=cFG6YQmp4XOM57QT1SdTMK3yk60AQgOhbbqNZ_zrk4DbdsiWoo6HKfcXVj8Qg4yxLZ9Nq0">You can also show your support by donating to our grassroots-led campaign here!</a></strong></em></span></p><p><strong><span>I know that Minneapolis can be a progressive leader and when we work together, we can tackle the problems we face. We can’t let our progress be delayed by gridlock. I promise to be a champion for the residents of Ward One. &nbsp;I will amplify our voices and be the advocate we need on the City Council.</span></strong></p><p><span>In solidarity,</span></p><h3><span>Jillia</span></h3><p><span>#JilliaForWard1</span></p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
