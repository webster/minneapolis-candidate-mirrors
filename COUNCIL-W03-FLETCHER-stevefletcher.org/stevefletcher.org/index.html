								</div>
								<div>I love the Third Ward! It’s an amazing place to live, and work, and create, and love. Every day, I walk my dog in Gold Medal Park, past the Guthrie, and the Mill City Museum, and the Stone Arch Bridge, and I feel lucky to get to live in this beautiful, walkable, neighborhood. We have great restaurants, an amazing arts community, an innovative tech startup scene, and so many smart, talented people we get to count as our neighbors. The rest of the city comes to Ward 3 to get things done. I’m running first and foremost out of love for the community that I call home.</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="section bg-white pb-3">
				<div class="container">
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-6">
							  <p>
I’m also running because by just about any metric, our city is failing to live up to our ambitions of racial equity and basic economic fairness, even as many of us enjoy a very comfortable quality of life. There’s an increasing disconnect between those who feel safer when police are nearby, and those who feel unsafe around our police. The new construction in our Ward has created a lot of great new dense, walkable places to live, and simultaneously reinforced economic and racial segregation that diminishes the potential vibrancy of our community and has left many struggling to find safe, affordable shelter. Many businesses are thriving and many of us are finding fulfilling work that meets our needs, while many are trying to get by on wages that cannot possibly sustain a family.
								</p>
								
									<p>
I’m running to represent Ward 3 because the choices we make in the next few years will determine whether we become a more fair, equitable and prosperous city for all of our residents, or whether we become further mired in the consequences of the deep racial and economic disparities that are holding us back. </p>
              <p>Like a lot of you, I was deeply disappointed on election night, and I’m afraid of the direction our country is going. If Donald Trump keeps his campaign promises, many of our neighbors are going to lose their health care.  </p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-6">
							
 <p>
Many more will lose worker protections that have kept our economy safe and stable.  We will be asked to turn our police resources on our Muslim and immigrant communities.  And we’ll likely face these challenges in a climate of steep budget cuts. Minneapolis will need to be a first line of defense for all of our residents. We will have to be willing to stand up to threats and bullying, but we have to do much more than that.  We have to model the alternative to Republican cynicism for the whole country by coming together as a community - by refusing to be divided from each other, or distracted from the work of building a thriving, inclusive, great city for all.								</p> 
          <p>
City government is the only place where transformational new ideas will be possible for the next couple years.  We’re already the best city by many measures, but we should aim higher.  What if we were the Best City in America to be a low wage worker?  Or The Greatest Place to build Black community wealth?  It’s going to take courage, and vision, and solidarity, and it’s going to take a City Council that will invite everyone in to be part of the resistance, and of the future of our community, together.  								</p>
          <p>In short, we can – and must – do better.
              </p>

							</div>
							<div class="mb-2">
                <p>Steve Fletcher is an accomplished technology professional, researcher, and community organizer with a strong reputation for bringing people together to solve problems and get things done.  He currently works as Director of Cloud Services for Kaizen Technology Partners - a technology firm where he manages network and data projects for mid-size and enterprise-level business clients. An entrepreneur by nature, Steve started his first business, a small video production company which had its first office in the Warehouse District, in 1995. That tiny office marked the beginning of Steve’s decades-long investment in the community of Ward 3.  </p><p>

Raised in a union household with strong social justice values, Steve has built a life and career grounded in a deep commitment to racial and economic justice, and the transformative potential of grassroots organizing. As someone who has worked in the arts as a video and film producer, as the son of two music teachers, and as the spouse of a working artist, Steve knows that our neighborhoods need creative energy to thrive.  As someone whose career accomplishments include leadership roles in business and in non-profit advocacy and organizing, Steve knows that our city needs pragmatism and broad public engagement in order to end racial disparities and ensure a sustainable quality of life for all of the Third Ward’s residents.</p><p>

In 2010, Steve served as the founding executive director of MN Neighborhoods Organizing for Change – a local grassroots movement-building hub that has gained national recognition for its justice-based organizing and policy wins. While Steve led NOC, the organization played an important role in the campaigns to defeat the discriminatory marriage and voter ID amendments in 2012, and launched impactful local campaigns around guaranteeing quality, affordable housing in Minneapolis and renewed investment in community public schools as a proven strategy to address racialized achievement gaps.  For his work with NOC, he was named Grassroots Solutions' 2011 Organizer of the Year.  He also served as Executive Director of Minnesota 2020, a progressive think tank that under his leadership played an important communications and research role in the campaign to raise the state's minimum wage, among other issue advocacy projects.  His consulting firm, founded in 2014, provided technical, communications, and strategic campaign guidance to a range of business, non-profit, and union clients.  </p><p>

A proud graduate of the University of Minnesota's highly-regarded American Studies program, Fletcher went on to earn a Masters in Philosophy in American Studies at New York University, where he studied and taught Metropolitan Studies.  </p><p>

He and his wife, Heather, live with their dog, Senator, in downtown East, where Heather runs her own small arts business and teaches at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts. A deeply rooted Ward 3 couple, Steve and Heather had their first date at the Sample Room and got engaged on the Stone Arch Bridge.   </p>
