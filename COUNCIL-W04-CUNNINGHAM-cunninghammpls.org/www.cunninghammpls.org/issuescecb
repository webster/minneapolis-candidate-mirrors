Gun violence threatens the livelihood of our community and the freedom for our children to just be kids and be out in our neighborhoods and parks. Criminal behavior also traps many members of our community in a cycle of involvement in the criminal justice system that locks them up and out of a fair shot at a future free of criminal activity.</p><p>As your City Councilmember, Phillipe will fight for strategies that are proven to sustainably enhance public safety. These strategies prevent criminal activity before it even happens to disrupt the cycle of someone’s involvement with the criminal justice system. Phillipe supports smart enforcement practices that increase police accountability to the community, and therefore enhance the police-community relationship.</p><p><em>Check back soon for more information on Phillipe’s work around public safety.</em></p>&nbsp;]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Community Wealth Building</title><dc:creator>Lane Cunningham</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 05:38:57 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.cunninghammpls.org/issues/community-wealth-building</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5861c756d2b857ddbd7b7978:58634f092994ca14baed9cd7:58634fe220099e8d8e7dc944</guid><description>The Northside has been left out of fully participating in Minneapolis’

According to the Census, the annual average household income is $12,194 less than the rest of the city. Phillipe already works hard to address this injustice in City Hall. As your City Council representative, Phillipe will continue to fight to bring job training programs to the Northside. He will also fight for a Office of Small Business at City Hall to provide entrepreneurs from our community with resources to succeed and create more small business and therefore jobs in North Minneapolis.</p><p>In order for us to even begin addressing the economic inequities that plague our community, people first need to earn a livable wage that can help stabilize families and get them on the path toward economic prosperity. Phillipe supports a $15 minimum wage throughout the region in order to make sure Northsiders are receiving a livable wage regardless of whether or not they work within Minneapolis city limits.</p><p>Check back soon for videos that have more detailed information on Phillipe’s work with economic development and about a $15 minimum wage.</p><p><a href="https://www.cunninghammpls.org/issues/community-wealth-building">Permalink</a><p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Youth Opportunities</title><dc:creator>Lane Cunningham</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 05:38:15 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.cunninghammpls.org/issues/youth-opportunities</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5861c756d2b857ddbd7b7978:58634f092994ca14baed9cd7:58634fb759cc68eba383194f</guid><description>If we set up our youth to succeed, our community will succeed.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<hr /><p>One of the most valuable lessons Phillipe has learned in his ten-year career as a youth worker is that one of the most effective ways we can make the biggest impact in our community is to provide positive and supported opportunities to young people. If we set up our youth to succeed, our community will succeed.</p><p>Phillipe works in City Hall and throughout Minneapolis to build meaningful impact in the lives of young people in our city. This is particularly true for Northside children and youth.</p><p>As your City Councilmember, Phillipe will continue to work with partners in the public and private sectors, as well as institutions of higher education to create internship opportunities and career pathways with secured jobs waiting for them upon graduation. Also, to ensure our children are ready to lead our city well, Phillipe will continue to build opportunities for youth in North Minneapolis to be civically engaged and to have a voice and developmentally-appropriate leadership opportunities in City Hall.</p><p>Come back soon to check out videos outlining more on Phillipe’s youth policies and valuable lessons from his experience as a youth worker.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Smart Governing</title><dc:creator>Lane Cunningham</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 05:37:32 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.cunninghammpls.org/issues/smart-governing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5861c756d2b857ddbd7b7978:58634f092994ca14baed9cd7:58634f7020099e8d8e7dc575</guid><description>Our current political climate requires city governments to be the guardians 
of a democracy that actually serve the people and not only special 
interests.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<hr /><p>With the election of Donald Trump to the presidency, we are now living in a new phase of American democracy. Trump’s ascension to the presidency was built on fear-mongering and hateful rhetoric against people of color, women, the LGBTQ community, Muslims, people with disabilities… The list goes on. State governments, including the State of Minnesota, are struggling to pass much-needed legislation and the residents are paying the price for political games. In city government, we can no longer afford political games. Our current political climate requires city governments to be the guardians of a democracy that actually serve the people and not only special interests.</p><p>To achieve this, municipal elected officials need the ability to work across differences. They need and a firm understanding of why equity is important to the future of our city, and the knowledge of how to enact equity through municipal policies and practices. As your City Councilmember, Phillipe will bring all of this and more. We can never move forward as a community unless we do it together. This can be achieved only through robust and meaningful community engagement and ensure on-going opportunities for community voice in the decision-making process. Phillipe is ready to serve Ward 4 constituents through providing fast response times and top-quality constituent services.</p><p>Check back soon for information about how his fresh perspective on how to govern in a multicultural city and why that’s important for our democracy.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
