"Right now, I'd say there's a huge lack of progressive values on the city council.</p><p>"The ward has been changing. The community has been changing and it's time for it to be reconnected to city hall, and for the community to feel like city hall is accessible to everyone."&nbsp;</p><p>Cunningham's book of work in Minneapolis government is thin, although he contends he's "been involved in a lot of things over a very short period of time."</p><p>He touts his involvement in expanding BUILD Leaders from a one-site pilot program to an ongoing initiative at multiple locations. BUILD is a youth violence prevention curriculum, in which 18- to 24-year-olds receive paid training in leadership and job skills. They take what they've learned to small classroom groups, talking to kids ages 9 through 12 years old. &nbsp;</p><p>According to city documents, BUILD's "primary focus of this project is to build employment readiness, develop fundamental job skills, and provide a foundation to build healthier cycles and habits."&nbsp;</p><p>"It was through my work inside the mayor's office, alongside the mayor to be able to bring [BUILD] to full life," Cunningham says.</p><p>Cunninghman couldn't say whether he will take a leave of absence from Hodges' staff during his campaign.</p><p>"We've been having conversations about that," he says. "Right now, I'm not sure right which direction I will take." &nbsp;</p><p>Cunningham's candidacy adds another element to the curious local political landscape as it matures in the months leading to next fall's elections.&nbsp;</p><p>Mayor Hodges, who already has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.citypages.com/news/nekima-levy-pounds-is-running-for-mayor-of-minneapolis/401182405">one challenger in Black Lives Matter activist Nekima Levy-Pounds</a>, has yet to be publicly endorsed by anyone on the council. (Other council members like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-is-getting-polled-about-the-mayors-race-is-there-a-mayors-race/397593761">Jacob Frey and Alondra Cano have been rumored</a>&nbsp;as potential mayoral candidates.) Moreover, one of her staff challenging a standing member shows city hall is officially a house divided.&nbsp;</p><p>Four years ago, Johnson was challenged by fellow Democrat Kris Brogan, a former restaurant owner and an affordable housing consultant. On Election Day, Johnson -- who had won the DFL Party endorsement -- took 57 percent of the vote to Brogan's 30 percent. (A Republican longshot collected 13 percent.)&nbsp;</p><p>But Cunningham wouldn't need many votes to make it a closer contest: Known for relatively low turnout, Ward 4 had only 3,940 votes cast in 2013's general election, the second-lowest total out of the city's 13 precincts. Only Blong Yang's election in north Minneapolis had fewer ballots cast (3,622); successful candidates in some wards received twice as many votes as the 2,153 Johnson got in her reelection.</p><p>This bodes well for Cunningham's rookie political campaign.</p><p>He expects to ask Hodges for her endorsement sometime in the future, saying, "We'll cross that bridge when it's time."</p><p> </p><p><strong>Read the full article here:&nbsp;http://www.citypages.com/news/phillipe-cunningham-staffer-for-mayor-betsy-hodges-wants-barb-johnsons-city-council-seat/403642536</strong></p>]]></description></item><item><title>MPR: Phillipe Cunningham finds success and respect as a transgender man</title><dc:creator>Nick Marcouiller</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 20:49:04 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.cunninghammpls.org/new-blog/2017/1/23/phillipe-cunningham-finds-success-and-respect-as-a-transgender-man</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5861c756d2b857ddbd7b7978:58865cb02994ca6b4ebcab89:58866a8920099e1900c5607a</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>by Cai Thomas | NextGenRadio</p><p><strong>Listen to the full interview here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mprnextgenfellows.org/phillipe-cunningham-finds-success-and-respect-as-a-transgender-man/">http://www.mprnextgenfellows.org/phillipe-cunningham-finds-success-and-respect-as-a-transgender-man/</a></strong></p><p> </p><p>Phillipe Cunningham sits on panel discussions, attends events and talk about his identity all the time. There’s one topic that he’s lately come to count on being asked about: bathrooms.</p><p>“I’m like, ‘Can we talk about poverty? Can we talk about educational disparities?’”</p><p>Where trans people go to the bathroom are just symbolism to him. They are not germane to the central issues of equity for trans people. It’s a lot like in the 60s, when arguments about lunch counters and water fountains were about much more than where people ate and drank.</p><p>Cunningham is 29 years old and he is a queer transgender black man. He transitioned six years ago. And it wasn’t all about bathrooms back then either.</p><p>He used to dread coming to the barbershop. Not because he was balding or suffering from a receding hairline, but because being around other black men was challenging.</p><p>In the sacred black male space of the barbershop, he wasn’t sure he’d be accepted.</p><p>The H. White Men’s Room in Minneapolis is the first barbershop where Cunningham told people about his trans identity. To his relief, he’s built friendships and established trust with the barbers in the shop.</p><p>Cunningham struggled with his identity for years. As early as four years old he wondered if he could be a boy. But a light bulb went off when he was 23 while doing research for his gay American history course at DePaul University in Chicago. He read the story of Lou Sullivan, an author and gay trans activist during the 1980s in San Francisco and was inspired to take steps toward his own transition.</p><p>“I had to unlearn my fear of men as someone who was socially conditioned as a woman,” Cunningham said. “I had to unlearn my fear of men in order to be comfortable, fully comfortable, with becoming one.”</p><p>Cunningham wondered whether he could be flamboyant, whether, as Phillipe, he could be expressive with his hands and walk with a swish in his hips. He found he can, and he feels fortunate.</p><p>“I have been very accepted by other black men even though I’m out as trans, even though I’m flamboyant,” Cunningham said. “Black men see me as a part of that community, and I have to say that that’s honestly so awesome as a trans man.”</p><p>Cunningham is a policy aide for Minneapolis Mayor, Betsy Hodges. He advocates on issues of education, youth success, LGBT and racial equity. He is co-coordinator of the White House’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative in the Twin Cities, which aims to uplift young men and boys of color.</p><p>Cunningham isn’t the first trans individual to work in city hall. Andrea Jenkins, a trans woman, blazed the trail as a staff member for two city council members.</p><p>His office, just steps away from the mayor’s, is adorned with images that photos of the people who’ve inspired him: his great-grandfather, whom he says was the last in his family to be born in slavery; author James Baldwin and activist Bayard Rustin, both openly gay during the 1950s and ’60s civil rights movement; and a business card with a quote: “I give myself the freedom to be me and it feels great.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Listen to the full interview here:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mprnextgenfellows.org/phillipe-cunningham-finds-success-and-respect-as-a-transgender-man/"><strong>http://www.mprnextgenfellows.org/phillipe-cunningham-finds-success-and-respect-as-a-transgender-man/</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>MPR: How one person learned to work beyond perceptions of identity</title><dc:creator>Nick Marcouiller</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 20:40:04 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.cunninghammpls.org/new-blog/2017/1/23/mpr-how-one-person-learned-to-work-beyond-perceptions-of-identity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5861c756d2b857ddbd7b7978:58865cb02994ca6b4ebcab89:588668ebe4fcb51867767e77</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>"Phillipe Cunningham's own evolution to becoming a trans black man helps him understand how to work beyond perceptions of identity.</p><p>Full story:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mprnextgenfellows.org/phillipe-cunningham-finds-success-and-respect-as-a-transgender-man/">Phillipe Cunningham finds success and respect as a transgender man</a></p><p>Cunningham, a policy aide in the Minneapolis mayor's office, shared his story with Cai Thomas, a producer in this year's <a href="http://www.mprnextgenfellows.org/">Next Generation Radio project</a>&nbsp;at MPR News.<em>"</em></p><p><strong>Listen to the full interview here:&nbsp;https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/10/07/next-gen-cai-thomas</strong></p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
