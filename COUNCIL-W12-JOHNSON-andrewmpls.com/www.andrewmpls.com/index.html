            Hi Neighbors,
            <br /><br />
            It has been an honor serving you over these past three years and I am happy to share that I will be running for re-election in 2017 to continue our great work together.
            <br /><br />
            
            As I kick-off my campaign for re-election, I hope to earn your support as a delegate for the DFL convention on Saturday, May 6th, and your vote in the November election.
            <br /><br />

            If you have any questions about my record or accomplishments, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:contact@andrewmpls.com">contact me</a>. Finally, none of this work could happen without the countless amazing staff, organizations, and individuals who work every day to make Minneapolis a better city... THANK YOU!
            <br /><br />
            ~ Andrew
