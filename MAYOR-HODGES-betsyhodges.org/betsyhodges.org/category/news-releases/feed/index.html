<h6 style="text-align: center;"><em>Contreras brings extensive experience in winning campaigns in Minnesota and nationally</em></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">January 2, 2017 (Minneapolis)—Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges announced today that she has hired Jorge Contreras to manage her 2017 campaign for reelection for a second term as mayor. </span><a href="http://betsyhodges.org/2016/12/15/re-election-campaign-launch-announcement-speech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hodges announced her bid for reelection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on December 15.</span></p>
<p>Mayor Hodges said, “Serving as Mayor of Minneapolis is the best job I can imagine. For me, it&#8217;s not a step on a career ladder: even on the hardest days, it&#8217;s an incredible privilege to serve the people of Minneapolis, whom I deeply love. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking to serve four more years.</p>
<p>“My campaign is grounded in the premise that in this era of Trump and Republican control — with our city and whole communities under attack, and more yet to come — now is the time to build on the many promises I have kept and results I have delivered to keep moving forward to becoming One Minneapolis. This campaign will help us as a people marshal our many strengths — which Trump and the Republicans underestimate, but I know in my bones we have — to rise to the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>“Jorge Contreras is the right person to lead my campaign. He is a determined, battle-tested leader with a solid track record of success and a solid commitment to progressive values. He inspires confidence in everyone around him by delivering results, communicating clearly, and always playing a long game. I look forward to working with him to build a winning grassroots campaign in every corner of our city.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, Contreras served as field director for 2016 DFL candidate Angie Craig in the 2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> congressional district. Under Contreras’ leadership, the Craig campaign had the top-producing field program in the country, making more than 2 million voter-contact attempts, twice as many than any other DCCC-targeted campaign. His Minnesota experience includes serving as regional organizing director for Senator Al Franken’s successful 2014 reelection campaign.</span></p>
<p>Contreras is a veteran of nine election campaigns, dating back to President Obama’s 2008 campaign. He has worked for statewide, congressional, countywide, and municipal campaigns in a total of 10 states, including a mayoral campaign in San Francisco, another city that uses ranked-choice voting in municipal elections. He has also organized for labor unions, labor-backed advocacy campaigns, and LGBT equality in California, Arkansas, and Utah.</p>
